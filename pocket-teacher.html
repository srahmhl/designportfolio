                <br>
                <p>With OpenAI's growing popularity (considering the integration into Bing and Google's expected competitor), tech-savvy and well-resourced students will have an unfair advantage over their peers. With Pocket Teacher, administrators will have the ability to mitigate that disparity and to better support their students in the tech world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Essentially, I wasn't just designing for the financial future of the company&mdash;I was also designing for Pocket Teacher's future students. By obsessing over the user experience, ease of use, and student safety, Pocket Teacher could transform the world of EduTech.</p>
